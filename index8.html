            The Liga 1, most often spelled as the Liga I (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈliɡa ɨnˈtɨj]; First League), is a Romanian professional league for men's association football clubs.<br>
            Currently sponsored by betting company Casa Pariurilor, it is officially known as the Casa Liga 1.<br>
            [1] It is the country's top football competition, being contested by 16 clubs which take part in a promotion and relegation system with the Liga II.<br> 
            The teams play 30 matches each in the regular season, before entering the championship play-offs or the relegation play-outs according to their position in the regular table.<br>

    The Liga I was established in 1909 and commenced play for the 1909–10 campaign, being currently on the 29th place in UEFA's league coefficient ranking list.<br>
    It is administered by the Liga Profesionistă de Fotbal, also known by the acronym LPF.<br>
    Before the 2006–07 season, the competition was known as Divizia A, but the name had to be changed following the finding that someone else had registered that trademark.[2]<br>

    The best performer to date is FCSB with 26 titles,[note 1] followed by longtime cross-town rival Dinamo București with 18 trophies.<br> Furthermore, of the remaining 21 clubs which came victorious in the competition eight have won it on at least three occasions—Venus
    București, Chinezul Timișoara, Petrolul Ploiești,<br> Ripensia Timișoara, UTA Arad, Rapid București, Universitatea Craiova, and CFR Cluj. The latter only became remarkably successful in the 21st century and is the most decorated club outside of Bucharest.

<h3>                    
    Early championships (1909–1921)

</h3>
<p>
    The first official national football tournament was organized in 1909 by the recently founded Romanian Football Federation,<br> 
    then called the Association of Athletic Societies in Romania (Romanian: Asociațiunea Societăților Atletice din România). <br>
    The final matches of the first Romanian Football Championship were held between December 1909 and January 1910 in Bucharest.<br>
    [3][4] The three pioneer clubs were Olympia and Colentina from Bucharest and United from Ploiești.<br>
     Each team played a fixture against the other two clubs, totalizing a number of three matches disputed,<br>
      with Olympia București being crowned as champions of the first Romanian Football Championship.<br>
     [3][5] In the following years, the tournament was structured into regional groups with the winners of each group participating in a playoff with the eventual winners being declared champions.<br>
      From 1909 until 1921, the championship was organized as a cup with the winner being crowned as Champions of Romania,<br>
      [3][5] except for between 1916 and 1919, when the competition was suspended due to World War I.<br>
      [6] The champions of this period were Olympia and Colentina,<br>
     each with two titles, and United, Prahova, Venus, Unirea Tricolor București and Româno-Americana, with one title each.

        Liga I (2006–present)
    </h2>

</p>

<p>
    At the beginning of the 2006–07 season the competition was forced to change its name from Divizia A to Liga I due to a trademark dispute over the name.<br>
    [2] The change was made on 15 May 2006, and the Romanian Football Federation decided to also rename the lower leagues; thus Divizia B became Liga II,<br>
     Divizia C became Liga III, and so on.[2] The 2006–07 season marked the 16th straight time a team from Bucharest won the championship, with Dinamo winning the title.<br>
      Both 2007–08 and 2008–09 saw new title winners as CFR Cluj and Unirea Urziceni were crowned champions for the first time.[3] CFR Cluj won their second championship in 2009–10,<br>
       while the 2010–11 saw another new winner, Oțelul Galați. Oțelul is the first and only club from the region of Moldavia to win a national title so far.

    CFR Cluj, the 2007–08 winner became the first Romanian team to qualify directly into the 2008–09 group stage of the UEFA Champions League, and the first team other than Steaua to qualify to this stage since the beginning of the new Champions League format in 1992–93.[12] The 2009–10 champions as well as 2010–11 ones were guaranteed a direct qualification spot into the group stage as well.[13] The best results in the group stage was obtained by CFR Cluj in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League with ten points and third place in a group with Manchester United, Braga, and Galatasaray.
    
    The 2010s also brought new league winners in Liga I, with Astra Giurgiu and Viitorul Constanța clinching the titles in 2015–16 and 2016–17 respectively.[14] Since 2017 onwards, CFR Cluj won four consecutive Liga I titles, amassing a total number of seven national titles as of 2021.

        Competition format
    </h3>
</p>

<p>
    Starting with 2020, the Liga I has been expanded to a 16-team format. After each team plays the others twice for 30 fixtures,<br>
     they are ranked by total points and then divided according to their position to enter either the championship play-offs or the relegation play-outs.<br>
      At this stage, the points are halved in two and criteria such as goal difference, goals scored etc. are erased completely.<br>

    The six clubs which enter the championship play-offs play ten games, while the remaining ten in the relegation play-outs will only play each other once,<br>
     resulting in nine fixtures. The championship play-offs winners are also crowned winners of the season's Liga I.<br>
      The 9th and 10th positions in the play-out are relegated directly to the Liga II,<br>
       while the 7th- and 8th-placed teams will play a two-legged tie against the 3rd and 4th teams from the second league's table.<br>
    
    Also, the 1st and 2nd teams from the play-out phase will play a one-legged game between each other and the winner will face the last team that completed the play-off phase in a European spot.<br> 
    The winner of that one-legged match will play next season in the UEFA Europa Conference League.
